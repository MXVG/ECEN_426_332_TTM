The main function reads an integer `n` which represents the number of test cases, and then for each test case, it reads an integer `k`, computes the number of ways `k` can be factored using the `fenjie` function, and prints the result.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the code:\n\n1. **Global Variable `sum`**: This variable is used to keep track of the number of factorizations found for a given integer.\n\n2. **Function `fenjie(int t, int n)`**:\n   - **Parameters**:\n     - `t`: The smallest factor to consider in the current recursive call.\n     - `n`: The number to be factored.\n   - **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, it means the product of factors leading to this call is a valid factorization, so `sum` is incremented.\n   - **Recursive Case**: The function iterates from `t` to `n`. If `n` is divisible by `i`, it recursively calls `fenjie` with `i` as the new `t` and `n/i` as the new `n`.
